# Task 1(EDA on Retail Sales Data)

In this, you will work with a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help the retail business make informed decisions.


# Task 2(Customer Segmentation Analysis)

The aim of this data analytics project is to perform customer segmentation analysis for an ecommerce company. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, the goal is to group customers into distinct segments. This segmentation can inform targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies.


# Task 3(Wine Quality Prediction)


The focus is on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, offering a real-world application of machine learning in the context of viticulture. The dataset encompasses diverse chemical attributes, including density and acidity, which serve as the features for three distinct classifier models.


# Task 4(Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression)


The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate a numerical outcome based on a dataset with relevant features. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm, and this project provides hands-on experience in developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.
